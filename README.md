# Royal Statistical Society: Data Science Section

The Data Science Section (DSS) of the Royal Statistical Society was [launched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aH3vVvtOfc) (slides available [here](https://github.com/rssdatascience/presentations/tree/master/20170624_launch_event)) in June 2017.

## Section Remit

The remit of the Data Science section (DSS) is to be a professional body that represents data scientists in the UK. The DSS will organise meetings for a broad range of attendees and generate outputs that are aimed at:

* Promoting good practice by addressing what good Data Science looks like (with exemplars) and what it does not look like.
* Promoting the statistical aspects of Data Science / reinforcing the statistical framework
* Being a trusted voice on Data Science for employers, including inputting to consultation exercises
* Supporting the Data Science community throughout the UK
* Supporting the pipeline and career development of data scientists and statisticians by elevating skill sets to work in the modern world
* Supporting important emerging topics such as ethics, privacy, algorithmic responsibility and personalization - lifting the quality of the conversation
* Fostering multi-disciplinary connections and the exchanging of ideas

## How do we communicate?

* We do substantive work on Github. This includes writing, sharing, commenting on workstream documents.
* We discuss broader issues and coordinate work streams on [Slack](https://rssdatascience.slack.com). For an invite please contact us at datascience [at] rss.org.uk. 
* We share ideas and publicise events on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/RSS_DSS).
* We use [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/11150048/) as our corporate homepage.
* We use the [RSS website](https://www.rss.org.uk) page [TBC] to describe the Section and how it is organised, enabling others to navigate to our output.
* We aspire to be self-organised without unnecessary structure and hierarchy but the RSS DSS committee reserves the right to manage the social media to maintain recognised rules of netiquette and [RSS Code of Conduct](http://www.rss.org.uk/Images/PDF/join-us/RSS-Code-of-Conduct-2014.pdf).

## What are we up to now?

Following our [launch event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aH3vVvtOfc) in June 2017, and the presentation of [twelve questions](https://github.com/rssdatascience/industrialisation) around the industrialisation and professionalisation of data science, we are planning a number of work streams based on addressing some of these questions.
